(Don't it feel good, babe, don't if feel good, baby?. It's our first time. It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals. You tossed it in the trash, you did. I lost her in the cold. No, no, no, no. Little Miss Perfect sitting at the train stop. Just go with it, go with it, go with it. Lift off and say goodbye. Hello. You know you look even better than the way you did the night before. Don't you worry about a thing babe. Yes, I would die for ya baby. i know i can make it, today my life begins. Take a bullet straight through my brain

Next stop Brooklyn. seems like pain has been my only friend. The only place to go - is all the way, ooh baby. You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah). Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah). Cause it's so brand new, babe, it's so brand new, baby. It's unfair, she's out there.... Now I'm lookin'.... Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash. Cause it's so brand new, babe, it's so brand new, baby!). Oh. a whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking. Girl, don't no need to be nervous,. Why were they open?. Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?

Oh oh, I would go through all this pain. leave the past behind me, today my life begins. Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same. She's, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn. Take, take, take it all, but you never give. While we were waiting, started conversating. Twenty-one years old. Red Nike high-tops, listening to hip-hop. She was covered in leather and gold. Before I got her name, along came a train (ohhhhh). I've been working hard so long. Take us to that special place. Ohhhhhhh!. I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah). And now here we are (here we are), in this big old empty room
</p>
<p>
And the moment that you kissed my lips you know I started to feel wonderful. Is that alright? Is that okay?. Ohhhhhhh!. Just let your fire set me free. And I will go real slow with it, slow with it. Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live oh. my fragile heart's been done so wrong. That place we went the last time, the last time. all around me i can feel a change (ohh). Ohhhhhhh!voom
